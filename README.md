# VideoTube - Backend Application (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary)

**VideoTube** is a backend application for a video-sharing platform similar to YouTube. Users can upload, update, delete videos, and interact with content through likes and comments. This project leverages Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Cloudinary for efficient media management and data storage.

## Features

- **Video Management**: Upload, update, and delete videos with integration to Cloudinary for media storage.
- **User Interaction**: Users can like and comment on videos to enhance engagement.
- **Database Management**: MongoDB is used to handle user data, video metadata, and interactions.
- **API Development**: RESTful APIs built using Express.js for CRUD operations with authentication and authorization.
- **Cloud Integration**: Cloudinary integration for video file storage and retrieval.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with scalability in mind for future growth in user base and content.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and video data.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud storage for media management (videos, images).
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user authentication and authorization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/VideoTube-backend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd VideoTube-backend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>
    JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
    ```

5. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/videos/upload**: Upload a video to the platform.
- **PUT /api/videos/:id**: Update video metadata.
- **DELETE /api/videos/:id**: Delete a video.
- **POST /api/videos/:id/like**: Like a video.
- **POST /api/videos/:id/comment**: Add a comment on a video.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia. Authentication is required for certain actions, such as liking a video or commenting.

## Future Improvements

- Implement video streaming and playback functionality.
- Add user authentication and authorization for roles (e.g., Admin, User).
- Implement more robust error handling and validation.
